#### Vacancies

There are occasionally vacancies for permanent and fixed-term positions in the group which will be linked to from here.

#### Research Visitors

We aim to support the exchange of ideas with researchers both in Argumentation and related fields so we welcome visiting scholars.

If you are interested in a research visit to ARG@ENU you should email a CV and covering letter describing your proposed research to Dr. Simon Wells.

However, visitors are encouraged and expected to find their own funding to support research visits.


#### Visiting Speakers

If you would like to contribute to our series of masterclasses or present your research in a seminar then please get in touch.
